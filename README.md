# React Webpack Boilerplate

This is an as simple as possible boilerplate for getting up and running with React via Webpack. The purpose of this is for quickly prototyping with all the goodness of the NPM system at your disposal.

## Setup Guide

`git clone git@github.com:jarsbe/react-webpack-boilerplate.git app`

`cd app`

`npm install`

`npm install webpack -g`

`webpack -w`

Webpack is now watching your project for changes. Open up a new terminal tab to boot up a server.

`cd app/site`

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and you should be good to go!
